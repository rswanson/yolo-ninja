      Readme: This file
      sets.cc: contains the main method that tests our implementation of sets
      sets.h: contains our implementation of sets.


To run the files (all files are to be run only when inside the submitted directory):
      type "g++ sets.cc" (without quotes) and press enter.  Then type "./a.out" (without quotes) and press enter.
      
To clarify, we automatically assumed the following premise for Range sets:
	  Range sets were implemented by inserting a range of values into the respective data structure as indivdual values from low to high. 
      Exceptions were caught for bin_search and the others work as directed.
